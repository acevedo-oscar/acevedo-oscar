    <p>I am recent graduate of UNAM&rsquo;s Technology program at the Center for Applied Physics and Advanced Technology (Centro de Física Aplicada y Tecnología Avanzada). My degree program was multidisciplinary, focusing on science (chemistry and physics), and technology (computer science and electronics).  Individually, my strongest areas are mathematics and coding, although I have microcontroller skills.</p>
<p>I am currently seeking a data-related internship or entry-level position. My goal is to have opportunities to bring data perspectives teams and help them make decisions that lead to success. Although I have an intrinsic curiosity about fundamental questions, I also value a practical mindset about getting a solution.</p>
<p>In the process of writing my thesis, I worked with a statistical model known as Generative Adversarial Network, which conventionally is a neural network-based model. Specifically, I designed a generative model for soil microbiome compositional data. I used the Python programming language and TensorFlow machine learning library and Python’s Pandas and Seaborn library for data cleaning, processing, and data visualizations. Also, I applied statistical hypothesis tests to validate data using the R Language.</p>
<p>In my last undergrad semester, I was an exchange student at Yonsei University, one of the top three universities in South Korea. It was the period of my life where I had the most personality development being an introvert myself. Moreover, it was my first experience of living abroad in a completely different culture. I lived in a university dormitory with people from different backgrounds and cultures.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was writing my thesis, I was a teaching assistant for an ordinary differential equations class at UNAM for a semester. I was responsible for overseeing computational lectures, writing exams, and teaching materials. During this role, I improved my written and oral communication skills.</p>
<p>My guiding principles and values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal responsibility: take ownership of what happens in your life.</li>
<li>Default proactive: don&rsquo;t wait for things to happen, go make things happen.</li>
<li>Discipline: the more discipline you have, the better your life will be. It applies to every area: waking up early, eating healthy, working out, finances, learning, etc.</li>
<li>Continue learning: you never know everything you need to know.</li>
</ul>
