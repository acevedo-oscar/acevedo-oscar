My thesis is about designing a [_Generative Adversarial Network_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) architecture for compositional data. 

# Compositional Data

Compositional data is noteworthy because of this kind of data occurs in different contexts. [Mathematically, compositional data is represented by points on a simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_data) , which means that given a point $$P_s(x_0,x_1,...,x_n)$$ then $$\sum_{k=0}^{k=n} x_k = 1$$ 

Some examples of compositional data are:

+ Molar concentrations in chemistry. 
+ Rock composition in geology.
+ Soil composition. 
+ [DNA sequencing data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6084572/)
+ [*Microbiome data*](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02224/full). In particular, this is the data I'm working on, besides some toy models that come from probabilities distributions.
