My thesis is about designing a [_Generative Adversarial Network_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) architecture for compositional data. 

# Compositional Data

Compositional data is noteworthy because of this kind of data occurs in different contexts. [Mathematically, compositional data is represented by points on a simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_data) , which means that given a point $$P_s(x_0,x_1,...,x_n)$$ then $\sum_{k=0}^{n} x_k = 1$ 

Some examples of compositional data are:

+ Molar concentrations in chemistry. 
+ Rock composition in geology.
