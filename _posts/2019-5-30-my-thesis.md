My thesis is about designing a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network](_Generative Adversarial Network_ ) architecture for compositional data. 

# Compositional Data

Compositional data is noteworthy because of this kind of data occurs in different contexts. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_data](Mathematically, compositional data is represented by points on a simplex.)

Some examples of compositional data are:

+ Molar concentrations in chemistry. 
+ Rock composition in geology.
