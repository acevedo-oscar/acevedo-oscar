I am a *Technology* undergraduate at *Center for Applied Physics and Advanced Technology of the UNAM* who completed all his credits. 

Currently, **I'm working on my thesis and community service**. My dissertation is about generating intestinal microbiota images using generative adversarial networks. These are machine learning models that represent probability distributions. Due to my multidisciplinary background  

For community service, I'm assisting fluids thermodynamics research at the *Multidisciplinary Teaching and Research Unit of the Faculty of Sciences of the UNAM*. In particular, I'm writing code for fluids molecular dynamics simulation.


Also, I a teaching assistant for an introductory course on ordinary differential equations at the Center for Applied Physics and Advanced Technology of the UNAM.
