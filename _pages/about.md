I'm a research assistant at UNAM. I studied _Technology_  at Center for Applied Physics and Advanced Technology, UNAM. The study program was general. I took some chemistry, physics and electronics classes, but ended up specializing in applied math with a focus on computational methods. 

Right now, I work as a research assitant writing code for complex fluids simulations. However, I'm interested in data analysis and machine learning products. 

At the same time, I'm writing my thesis about using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate compositional data. I have some results, so I'm about three quarters done,  though paperwork will take time.
