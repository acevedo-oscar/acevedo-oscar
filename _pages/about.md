I'm a research assistant at UNAM. I studied _Technology_  at Center for Applied Physics and Advanced Technology, UNAM. The study program was general. I took some chemistry, physics and electronics classes, but ended up specializing in applied math with a focus on computational methods. 

**Right now, I work as a research assistant writing code for complex fluids simulations. However, I'm interested in data analysis and machine learning products.**

At the same time, I'm writing my thesis about using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate compositional data. I have some results, so I'm about three quarters done, though paperwork will take a little bit of time.

As a hobby, I like reading non-fiction books and studying the Korean language.
