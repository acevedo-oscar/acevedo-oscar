I am a Technology an alumnus. I studied at the Center for Applied Physics and Advanced Technology of the UNAM who completed all his credits. 

Currently, I'm working on my thesis about generating compositional data using Generative Adversarial Networks. One example of compositional data is intestinal microbiota abundances.

As a hobby, I like reading non-fiction books and studying the Korean Language.
